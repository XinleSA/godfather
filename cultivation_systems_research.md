## Key Findings

### Cultivation System Structure
From research, the cultivation system is described as:
- **Nine grades** (九品)
- **Three realms** (三境)
- **Four phases** (四相)
- **Two divisions** (二分)
- **Above grade one** (超品)

### Faction Systems Mentioned
1. **Taoists** - Claim to be the strongest
2. **Warriors** - Considered "crudest and least presentable" by other systems
3. **All other systems** - Each believes they are the strongest

### Character Abilities Context
- **Xu Qi'an**: Shows exceptional intelligence (solved tax silver case in 12 breaths vs normal 15+ breaths)
- **Night Watchmen Requirements**: At least three generations of unblemished family history
- **Intelligence Testing**: Measured in "breaths" taken to solve problems
- **Wei Yuan**: Strategic leader with deep knowledge of cultivation systems

### Magical Elements Referenced
- **Mystical abilities** vs **brute strength** (warriors lack mystical powers)
- **Upper limits of cultivation systems** - secret knowledge
- **Refining Spirit stage** - allows detection of hostile intent and killing intent
- **Peerless Martial God** - Xu Qi'an's special ability
- **Half-Step Martial God** - advanced cultivation level

### World Building Elements
- **Night Watchmen compound** with Haoqi Tower as central structure
- **Observation decks** on upper floors
- **Tea rooms** for strategic discussions
- **Formal ranking system** (Bronze Gong, Silver Gong, Gold Gong)

## Additional Research Needed
- Detailed breakdown of the nine grades system
- Specific abilities for each faction (Confucian, Taoist, Buddhist)
- Progression mechanics between grades/realms/phases
- Specific spells, techniques, and magical items from each system
- Experience point values for different cultivation achievements

## Game Implementation Notes
- Intelligence-based skill checks (measured in "breaths" or time taken)
- Faction-specific skill trees with unique abilities
- Cultivation progression system with clear grade advancement
- Investigation mechanics tied to cultivation level
- Character background requirements affecting available paths
